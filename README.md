# JavaCodingBasics
This folder contains lots of java packages with so many classes and interfaces.
All classes have created under Object Oriented Programming rules.
Experimented with Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism,Generics, Collection, List and Stream.
I have coded all the intermediate operations to built and customised the processing using map()/flatMap(),filter(),limit()/skip(),sorted(),distinct() and peek()
